Build a complete, production-ready, end-to-end full-stack Flight Booking System intended for a real technical hiring assignment, using Node.js with Express.js for the backend, MongoDB with Mongoose for persistent storage, and React with TailwindCSS for the frontend, ensuring the application is fully functional, visually premium, psychologically engaging, animation-rich, and runnable end-to-end without placeholders, TODOs, mock data, static JSON, random generators, or external APIs; the backend must automatically connect to MongoDB on startup and seed exactly 15–20 realistic flight records if none exist, stored in collections explicitly named flights, bookings, wallets, and pricing_attempts, where each flight strictly includes { flight_id (unique string), airline, departure_city, arrival_city, base_price (₹2000–₹3000), current_price }, and cities are strictly chosen from [Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune, Kochi, Ahmedabad, Jaipur] with no same departure and arrival city; implement a database-driven flight search that always fetches exactly 10 flights filtered by departure and arrival city, never cached or static; implement a backend-only dynamic surge pricing engine that tracks booking attempts per user per flight using timestamps stored in pricing_attempts, such that if the same user attempts to book the same flight three times within a rolling five-minute window, the price increases by exactly 10%, a visible “Surge +10%” badge appears on the UI, and the surged price automatically resets to the original base_price exactly ten minutes after the last attempt without server restarts; implement a persistent wallet system initialized automatically with one user (default_user) having ₹50,000 balance stored in the wallets collection, display the wallet balance persistently in the top navigation bar, deduct the final surged price atomically upon successful booking, prevent bookings when balance is insufficient, and show clear red error alerts with smooth fade-in animations; implement the complete booking flow with a confirmation modal that animates in using scale-and-fade motion, stores bookings in the bookings collection with passenger name, flight details, final price, booking timestamp, and a uniquely generated uppercase alphanumeric PNR of exactly 6 characters, then generate a professional downloadable PDF ticket on the backend containing passenger name, airline, flight ID, route formatted as “Departure → Arrival”, final price prefixed with ₹, booking date formatted as DD MMM YYYY, HH:mm, and the PNR highlighted clearly, ensuring tickets can be downloaded immediately and again later from booking history; design a premium, recruiter-impressing frontend where the landing page includes a subtle animated hero section with slow-moving gradient background inspired by airline brands using a calming yet engaging color palette (deep blue #0f172a for trust, sky blue #38bdf8 for motion, soft purple #a78bfa for modernity, and white for clarity), include smooth entrance animations for headings and search card using Framer Motion, apply micro-interactions such as button hover lifts, card hover elevation, ripple click feedback, and smooth transitions everywhere; use a custom airplane-shaped cursor icon that slightly tilts based on mouse movement and reverts to default on mobile devices; ensure the main search card is centered with max-width ~900px, rounded-2xl corners, shadow-xl, padding ≥24px, with 44px height inputs, blue focus rings, and a primary call-to-action button styled to attract clicks; render search results as animated flight cards that slide-in sequentially, each card having rounded-xl corners, subtle borders, spacing of 16px, airline name in semi-bold typography, route text with arrow icon, flight ID in muted gray, dynamic price display that animates when surge pricing activates, and a clearly visible “Book Now” button aligned right; include a booking history page with smooth page-transition animations, responsive card or table layout, clear spacing, download-ticket buttons with hover feedback, and consistent design language; ensure the UI is responsive, readable, visually calming yet engaging to increase time-on-site, and subtly guides the user’s attention using color contrast and motion; structure the backend cleanly with models, routes, controllers, and utility functions for pricing logic and PNR generation, ensure all REST endpoints (/api/flights/search, /api/bookings/create, /api/bookings/history, /api/bookings/ticket/:pnr, /api/wallet/balance) return consistent JSON responses with success and error flags, handle all errors gracefully, prevent duplicate bookings within the same minute, purge expired pricing attempts automatically, and ensure database seeding, wallet initialization, and server startup are fully automatic; finally include a professional README explaining project overview, tech stack, features, surge pricing logic, wallet rules, animations used, UI design rationale, setup instructions, and how to run the app locally, ensuring the entire codebase reflects clean architecture, polished UX, animation finesse, and production-quality standards expected by senior full-stack engineers reviewing a hiring assignment.
