✈️ SkyVoyage Booking System: Full-Stack Flight Reservation ApplicationThis repository contains the complete codebase for the SkyVoyage Booking System, a modern, full-stack application designed to simulate a comprehensive flight reservation experience, including searching, seat selection, and booking management. This is the finalized version configured for local development and demonstration.✨ Key Features & FunctionalityFlight Search & Booking Flow: Allows users to search for one-way flights, select seats from a dynamic map, input passenger details, and complete a simulated payment process.Booking Management (Local User): Users can view their past and upcoming bookings and cancel existing trips, which automatically releases reserved seats.Admin Panel: Includes administrative routes for viewing all system flights and all user bookings for reporting and management (accessible locally).Modern UI/UX: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user experience across devices.🏛️ Technical ArchitectureThis project employs a robust, three-tier full-stack architecture built on modern JavaScript/TypeScript standards.Frontend (Client):Technology: React with TypeScript.Styling: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.Routing: wouter for lightweight client-side navigation.Backend (Server):Technology: Express.js with TypeScript (server/index.ts, server/routes.ts).ORM: Drizzle ORM (TypeScript-native ORM) for managing database interactions.API Design: A clean, RESTful API providing data for flights, airports, and booking transactions.Database (Data Layer):Platform: Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL).Data Integrity: Schema defined in Drizzle and managed with PostgreSQL for reliable, relational data storage.Seeding: The database is seeded with necessary mock data (flights, airports) to ensure the application is functional immediately upon setup.🛠️ Development & Deployment StatusThis project is fully operational and configured for immediate local execution.AreaTechnical AchievementAuthenticationMocked User Authentication: External login services were intentionally removed. The system uses a static local user ID (DUMMY_LOCAL_USER) defined in the backend to manage bookings and demonstrate user-specific features (My Trips/Admin Panel).Database ConnectivitySuccessfully connected to a Neon PostgreSQL instance using environment variables (.env) for secure access and managed by Drizzle ORM.Project CleanlinessAll unnecessary files and configuration code related to previous development environments have been removed, resulting in a lean, production-ready folder structure.To run the application locally:Clone the repository: git clone [repository url]Install dependencies: npm installConfigure environment: Set up your .env file with the Neon PostgreSQL connection string.Run the backend: npx tsx -r dotenv/config server/index.tsRun the frontend: npm run dev (or your client start command)
